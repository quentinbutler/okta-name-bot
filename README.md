# Okta-Name-Bot

## Before you get started / prerequisites

Before you get started, you will need:

- Access to an Okta tenant with Okta Workflows enabled for your org

- HRIS System such as Workday

- Slack 

## Problem

Employee imports aren't always perfect. Sometimes, there can be a mistake made entering the username or primary email in the HRIS system.

## Solution

This bot will find errors and alert a Slack channel when there is a mismatch between username and primary email of user when imported. This saves time from the user potentially being locked out and from IT reaching out to HR to fix.
